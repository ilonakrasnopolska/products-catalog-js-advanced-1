# Dynamic CSS and Module Loading Project

This project demonstrates dynamic loading of CSS stylesheets and modules, as well as working with promises, `Promise.all()`, and fetching data from an API. The main functionality of the project is to fetch random product cards from a server API and display them with the product image, name, and price. Clicking on the "More Info" button for each product navigates the user to a new page with detailed information about the product. The URL string changes dynamically based on the product ID.
